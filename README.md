When index.js is run by the user, they are prompted with questions to gather information for making profile cards for each team member including name, id, email, etc.

## Usage
- Use this application to create profiles for team members to easily reference basic information of each team member, like email, github, office number etc. The "EXAMPLEgenerated.html" file is the file I created in the demonstration link. The "generated.html" file in the dist folder is whats created when using the application. When viewing your newly created team profile cards, please see "generated.html" file in dist folder.
